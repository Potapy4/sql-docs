# Previous versions of SQL Server documentation

The documentation for several older versions of Microsoft SQL Server has been archived. Yet the archived documentation _remains available_ at:

- [SQL Server previous versions documentation](/previous-versions/sql/) <!-- https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/sql/ -->

> [!CAUTION]
> Use the _Version_ dropdown list control to select the version of SQL Server you want to see documentation for. The control is available near the top of this webpage.
>
> In the dropdown list, the value labeled **SQL Server previous versions** allows this article to be displayed. This version value also hides most other articles. Almost every other version value hides this article.
>
> The documentation for a _newer_ version of SQL Server is available [here](../sql-server/sql-server-technical-documentation.md?toc=../toc/toc.json&view=sql-server-2017).

## Archived documentation

### Offline documentation and the Help Viewer

Offline editions of the SQL Server documentation are available for download, for the newer and older versions of SQL Server. On your local computer, you use the _Help Viewer_ tool to both download and view any edition of the offline books. The Help Viewer is available in the Help menu in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
